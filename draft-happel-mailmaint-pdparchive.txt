1.  Introduction

   As part of communication protocols, the IETF has standardized a
   number of data formats such as the Internet Message Format [RFC5322],
   vCard [RFC6350], iCalendar [RFC5545], or, more recently, JSContact
   [RFC9553] and JSCalendar [RFC8984].

   While mainly designed for interoperability, many of these data
   formats have also become popular for data portability, i.e., the
   import/export of data across different services.  The growing
   importance of data portability however demands for an open standard
   archive format which can deal with different types of personal data
   in a homogeneous fashion.

   To this end, this document proposes the Personal Data Portability
   Archive format (PDPA), suitable for import/export, backup/restore,
   and data transfer scenarios for personal data.  It is compatible with
   both IMAP and JMAP and should be suitable as an interchange format
   between related software and services such as for email, contacts,
   calendaring, tasks, or files.

   The approach is to define JSON formats (using CDDL), folder
   structure, and a common compression format.  Additional
   specifications will likely define a protocol how these files can be
   requested from, imported into, or transferred between servers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The term "personal data" refers to persistent data which users
   created and managed within applications or services.  Classic
   examples are emails, contacts, calendars, tasks, notes, or files.
   Other examples might be fitness tracking records, energy bills, or
   location history.

   The term "data portability" refers to the right or technical
   procedure to use or transfer personal data across different
   applications or services.

   The terms "message" and "email message" refer to "electronic mail
   messages" or "emails" as specified in [RFC5322].  The term "Message
   User Agent" (MUA) denotes an email client application as per
   [RFC5598].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Goals

   The core goal is to provide an open and extensible archive and
   transfer format for personal data.  This includes data types that are
   subject of existing IETF protocols, such as email and groupware data
   (e.g., contacts, calendars, tasks) but may also include further types
   of personal data.

   Goals will be refined by use cases and cross-cutting technical goals
   in the following sub-sections.

   JSON is used as a widely interoperable base format that systems can
   easily translate their internal data representation into.  Wherever
   possible, fields, values and data structures are derived from
   existing IMAP/JMAP specifications to remain compatible with both.

3.1.  Use cases

3.1.1.  Data portability

   A main use case for the novel format is to allow exporting the full
   user data managed by services or software products into a simple file
   (or set of files) which is under full control of the user.

   The user might use such export for backup, archiving, or for
   importing when switching to another service or software (i.e.,
   migration).

   Depending on the type of data, exporting/importing can be a time-
   consuming process.  Particularly for the case of switching services,
   PDPA should allow to minimize the time period during which a user
   cannot use the origin system but also the destination system is not
   yet ready.

3.1.2.  Incremental backup

   Beyond snapshot backups/exports, the format should optionally allow
   for incremental backups.

   There are at least two scenarios for this:

   *  Software which wants to keep a permanent, incremental mirror of
      user data (e.g., for instant export or restore)

   *  Users regularly exporting changes in data managed by services or
      software products

3.1.3.  Synchronization

   Data portability does not just allow users to switch from one service
   to another one, but to let users benefit from 3rd party services
   getting a copy of their data (at the request of the user).  Simple
   synchronization features could make this much better.

   For example, current online systems that allow importing contacts are
   not often suited to maintaining one's address book on two systems.
   Re-importing a contact into a system that already has that contact
   often results in duplicating the exact same contact, whether or not
   there have been edits, making repeated synchronization practically
   infeasible.  It should be easy to do a significantly better job of
   this with some attention to object IDs and modification timestamps.

   We however do not attempt to solve two-way synchronization via export
   files.  It would require significant additional work to allow two
   systems, neither of which is agreed-upon to be the source of truth,
   to reliably synchronize changes from both.  In comparison, solving
   one-way synchronization only requires agreed-upon usage of existing
   fields and values.

3.1.4.  Dataset exchange

   PDPA should be usable to exchange and share larger data sets than
   just one user, or to share a single user's data outside the context
   where the user knows what it is and where it came from.

   Potential applications of this are:

   *  The ability to exchange test data and known mailstore state, e.g.
      for conformance testing or internal functional tests

   *  Legal discovery and forensics use cases may benefit from a
      standard export format, such that investigators can expect a great
      deal of consistency when collecting data from different systems.

   *  Researchers may be able to collect archive files through data
      donations and use as input to research.

   While these use cases may suggest small features that would help
   these use cases be successful, supporting more advanced features
   required by these use cases is not a priority.  For example, we do
   not attempt to cryptographically solve provenance for use in legal
   and forensics use cases.

3.1.5.  Data persistence

   The format MAY be used as a development-time active persistence layer
   for user data in, e.g., email clients or applications.  It is not
   intended as, or suitable for, a production-level persistence layer.

3.2.  Technical Goals

   Besides actual use cases, there are a number of side requirements and
   goals for PDPA.

3.2.1.  Email standards compatibility

   Data formats should aim for compatibility with JMAP data formats for
   the sake of interoperability and synergies in software libraries.

   Dedicated JMAP API methods for exporting and importing the format
   described here, or for related server-to-server transfer protocols
   are out of the scope of this document.

   Due to its specifics and ubiquitous usage, the Internet Message
   Format [RFC5322]; latest revision of [RFC2822]/[RFC822] should be the
   core of representing individual email data.

   This specification should ideally describe mappings between PDPA and
   existing mailbox persistence schemes such as Maildir or MBOX
   [RFC4155].

3.2.2.  Interoperability

   It should be mostly possible to use personal data exports from one
   system with different software or services.  When a source exports
   personal data it can include all the information it would need for a
   fully-functional import, _however_ destination systems running
   different software may not be able to import all of that information
   (especially if it includes non-standard features) and use it exactly
   the same way.  This specification does not attempt to achieve perfect
   interoperability between diverse systems, but instead to make
   reasonable trade-offs.

3.2.3.  Extensibility

   This format should be extensible to accommodate types of personal
   data not explicitly mentioned or foreseen when writing these specs.

3.2.4.  Flexible granularity

   This format should allow flexible granularity in two ways:

   1) It should enable easy access to separate types of data (e.g.,
   emails vs. contacts), e.g. to allow for partial imports or exports

   2) While ideally representable as a single file, archives may also
   span several files due to reasons such as file size restrictions or
   incremental generation logic.

   (The ability for a user to export and/or backup an entire email
   account requires some accommodation of large amounts of data and
   risks of interruptions in downloads.  Splitting exports into multiple
   files during export is one possible solution.)

3.2.5.  Accessible for local tooling

   PDPA should allow easy access for local tools (e.g., CLIs).  While
   this may sound obvious, it is a key factor for the intended
   versatility of the format.

3.2.6.  Efficiency

   Since certain kinds of personal data might involve large quantities
   of data, major use cases for PDPA should be realizable in an
   efficient manner.

   For now, this is stated as an abstract guiding principle.  Its actual
   dimensions and trade-offs need to be refined while evolving this
   specification.

3.3.  Related work

   Many email server implementors have found it desirable to have one or
   more file formats for storing email in a file system even when the
   primary active email storage is more commonly a database.  Examples
   include [PST] files (Outlook), NSF (Notes), [GoogleTakeout], Maildir,
   MBOX.  File formats are already used for interoperability in many
   cases even when not standardized.

   This specification follows that pattern in order to build on these
   partial successes.  By standardizing one format, we expect to be able
   to satisfy use cases that are harder to satisfy with a plurality of
   formats, such as use cases for server-to-server transfer of email
   account data during account migrations.  Specifications that explain
   how to create these archives in different situations can refer to
   this specification.

4.  Approach

4.1.  Using JSON (mostly)

   JSON is used in this spec for new metadata and for objects including
   contacts, tasks, events and notes.  However, the Email Message Format
   [RFC5322] is used for email message content.  Individual items are
   stored in individual files, which are referenced in collection
   metadata.  Finally these JSON and other file formats are packaged and
   compressed together in a standard but flexible way.

   Our rationale for using JSON as much as it is reasonable:

   *  We envision an export format being used not just by developers of
      full IMAP servers but also by developers building task management
      systems, calendar systems that don't include email, etc.

   *  We should minimize requiring multiple libraries to parse different
      formats.  If the Metadata is going to be in JSON, it would really
      help to have the item data in JSON.

   *  Personal data formats must be extensible and extensibility for
      JSON is well-understood.

   Using JSON for all the data _except_ EML files was carefully
   considered.  EML files are rather specialized and more challenging to
   replace.  Much of email is not structured data but content and
   involves MIME.  EML is more likely to be a system's native data
   store, unlike VCARD and VTODO which are most commonly transformed for
   use in a relational data store for active use.  Finally, email
   signature implementations like S/MIME and OpenPGP would be less
   disrupted by keeping EML.

   Information not covered by these existing file formats, but still
   necessary for migration or backup/restore of an email account, is
   packaged into JSON files.  JSON structure and values are defined with
   CDDL [RFC8610].  The JSON files for email folders and other
   collections contain references to individual resources by unique ID
   and filename.

4.2.  Approach to partial updates

   Our use case requirements above (use_cases) included some very common
   personal use cases that motivate exporting only a time-limited set of
   items, but retaining the ability to use that subset export to update
   a previously acquired or maintained snapshot.  These are partial
   updates - partial exports able to update a full copy.  Our approach
   is to define a version of the archive format that includes a subset
   of a repository's content, and additionally some change markers
   necessary to maintain consistency.

   A partial-update export

   *  Contains new items just like a full export.

   *  Omits unchanged items from before the time cutoff.

   *  Does NOT list unchanged items in folder listings either.

   *  Allows updated items to be identified so they can replace previous
      versions

   *  Allows deleted items to be identified so they could be removed in
      the updated snapshot

   The existing definitions for UIDs and 'updated' in JMAP and IMAP
   should make this quite possible.  Also IMAP MODSEQs [RFC7162] can be
   used for flag changes.

4.3.  Approach to synchronization

   Email and calendaring services appear to already do synchronization
   just fine, but this is via a client-server model.  The client drives
   the read and write requests until content is synchronized, using
   mostly UIDs and timestamps.

   Archive and export formats aren't part of this client-server model,
   and the work to make server-to-server or peer-to-peer synchronization
   work perfectly is substantial (involving features such as version
   numbers or change logs -- features that aren't commonly standardized
   for the objects handled in this spec).  Still, there are some things
   possible with archive formats and the current object definitions that
   are sensible.  Our approach is to describe what is possible with the
   fields that exist, and mandate those fields be used, so that users
   aren't left with multiple locations for their data and no way to
   repeatedly synchronize them.

   As an illustrative use case, let the user have contacts stored in one
   email service and also in one mobile device platform doing online
   backups.  The email platform creates contacts when the user emails
   new recipients, or receives contact information over email.  The
   mobile device platform synchronizes contact information from a phone.
   The email service is not a client of the mobile device platform, nor
   is the mobile device platform a client of the email service, so
   client-to-server protocols cannot directly synchronize the data
   between these two services.  A user attempting to solve this by
   repeatedly importing contacts into one system from the other may find
   this works poorly - for example, it might create new contact objects
   over and over for the same contact data even if it is unchanged, and
   deleted objects may re-animate after being re-copied.

   Both servers ought to allow exporting of contact data (along with any
   other data covered in this specification), including especially the
   UID and updated (timestamp) fields.  This would allow at least some
   sensible personal workflows or for 3rd party tools to make
   synchronization work better.

   When importing contact data (along with any other data covered in
   this specification), a service needs to take note of the UID in the
   import, and use it as the UID for creating a new object, so that it
   may be later avoid being recreated.  If the service importing already
   has the said UID, the service should compare 'updated' timestamps and
   use that to decide how to update the object with new values.  An
   object that hasn't changed since last imported should remain
   unchanged and not updated.

   This approach to synchronization is imperfect.  Let the user have
   performed one synchronization by exporting from the email service and
   importing to the mobile device platform.  If the user updates a
   contact on the email service (e.g adding a street address) and the
   mobile platform also updates the contact (e.g. adding an avatar
   link), then the user attempts to repeat the synchronization, both
   services will have a new 'updated' timestamp on the same object UID,
   and the earlier of the two changes will get wiped out.  Nevertheless,
   a disciplined user can remember to only make changes on the email
   service and always copy them over to the mobile platform, and avoid
   many such lost updates.

   Based on the approach described here, this specification standardizes
   some behavior for both exporters and importers, to maximize potential
   success.

5.  Solution Requirements

   These technical requirements on the solution are intended to meet the
   goals above, and to add more specifics about how those goals are
   intended to be met with the architecture chosen.  This section does
   not attempt to translate the solution requirements into implementor
   requirements.

   Folder format requirements

   *  can include partial results, showing only a subset of objects
      within the folder

   *  can include a human-readable representation of the meaning of that
      subset (e.g. a date filter, or recipient filter)

   Email object format requirements

   *  can maintain full fidelity including preserving character sets,
      content transfer encoding of body parts and exact MIME structure

   Compression and packaging of resources

   *  Servers can bundle resources together in different ways to be
      flexible in handling size and network limitations.  Servers must
      be able to choose optimal file size and organization of
      information within files.

   Synchronization requirements

   *  Can see which items are identical in two systems, e.g. one system
      previously imported an item exported by the other.

   *  Can detect changes made since the last time an item was imported,
      in a way that supports replacing an older version previously
      synchronized with a newer version that has edits.

6.  File format

   This section describes the internal "raw" file format of a personal
   data portability archive.  For discussion about a surrounding
   container format, see section "open issues".

   PDPA in general consists of:

   *  A main metadata file ("index.json")

   *  Top-level folders for each data type ("/mail")

   *  Subfolders representing actual collections of individual data
      items plus additional metadata files

6.1.  Index file(s)

   The index.json file consists of three main sections:

   *  archive: general information about the archive

   *  dataset: characteristics of the dataset itself

   *  datasource: meta-information about the dataset

   The following sections propose some initial properties which are
   still subject to discussion.

6.2.  Folder structure

   *  Folders can be nested.  Any kind of content here can be within
      nested folders -- this is a necessary feature for email, but
      extends to content like contacts that aren't always represented in
      nested folders.  (TODO: elsewhere, describe the requirements for
      an importing system to preserve folders or not.)

   *  Names of files do not have to be globally unique.  Indexes and
      folder contents listings can name files relatively to their
      location in the archive structure, which means that references may
      not be resolvable if that context is lost.

   *  Individual content items are individual files.  This may not
      always be the easiest choice for exporters who must generate a
      large number of files for individually small items (contrast to a
      JSON stream including all objects) but as an archive format, the
      individual files allow more clarity in individual handling,
      transactions and errors.

      TODO: I18n?  Special-use?

   Folder names are defined in RFC9051 (IMAP v4 rev2) with great freedom
   for servers.  Servers may or may not treat mailbox names as case
   sensitive.  Folder names may even include non-graphic characters, "%"
   and "*".  Hierarchy separators may even differ among IMAP servers
   although "/" is probably most common.

   Since this specification is new, it is possible to be more
   constrained.  This specification only supports "/" as a folder
   separator.

6.3.  Data formats

6.3.1.  Email

   Each IMAP/JMAP folder is represented as subdirectory under "mail"
   directory.  For example, the folder INBOX would be represented as
   "mail/INBOX", and the folder "Archive/2024/2024-12" would be
   represented as "mail/Archive/2024/2024-12".

   (In examples above "/" is the IMAP hierarchy delimiter)

   Folder names are encoded in UTF-8.

   TODO: how to signal removal of a folder in an incremental archive?
   Need to add some kind of tombstone mechanism.

   Each folder metatadata is described by "folder.json", which has the
   following format:

6.3.2.  Contacts

   VCard [RFC6350] has long been the basis for address book and contact
   data representation in structured data files.  The specifications for
   JSContact [RFC9553] and JMAP for Contacts [RFC9610] do a bunch of the
   work to explain how to do this in JSON, and in particular RFC9610
   explains how to express references between objects (e.g. an address
   book and a contact in that address book) which is useful for a full
   export that can have its references reconstructed.  This section
   explains how to use the fields and structures of those specifications
   within a PDP Archive export.

6.3.2.1.  Individual Contact Items

   Individual contact items build on JSContact [RFC9553] which builds on
   VCard [RFC6350].

   *  The globally unique uid property is mandatory in JSContact and
      MUST be included in PDP archive.

   *  The updated property is optional in JSContact but MUST be included
      in PDP archive.

   *  The rev property defined in VCard (RFC6350), which is not included
      in JSContact [RFC9553], may already be available in
      implementations.  It may also be included as a field on a contact,
      in which case it is a simple value field holding a timestamp.

   *  The @type property should be "ContactCard".  Note that JSContact
      [RFC9553] uses a value of "Card" for @type and registers that in
      https://www.iana.org/assignments/jscontact/jscontact.xhtml, but
      JMAP for Contacts uses "ContactCard" and registers that in
      https://www.iana.org/assignments/jmap/jmap.xhtml.

   We make some specific requirements on the updated value so that it
   can be useful for synchronization.  See the section on updated and
   uid specifically [TODO: cross-reference other section].

   When the structured data is prepared, a contact can be exported in a
   file with an arbitrary name using a limited set of characters
   suitable for interoperability across filesystems.  [TODO: we need to
   define that elsewhere].

   For example, a file called 'contact1.json' could contain:

   {
      "@type": "ContactCard",
      "version": "1.0",
      "uid": "22B2C7DF-9120-4969-8460-05956FE6B065",
      "id":
      "updated": "2021-10-31T22:27:10Z",
      "kind": "individual",
      "addressBookIds": [
         "062adcfa-105d-455c-bc60-6db68b69c3f3"
      ]
      "name": {
          "components": [
            { "kind": "given", "value": "John" },
            { "kind": "surname", "value": "Doe" }
          ],
          "isOrdered": true
      },

      "relatedTo": {
         "urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6": {
            "relation": {
              "friend": true
            }
          }
      },

      "notes": {
        "n1": {
          "note": "Open office hours are 1600 to 1715 EST, Mon-Fri",
          "created": "2022-11-23T15:01:32Z",
          "author": {
            "name": "John"
          }
        }
      }
   }

   For clarity, this example includes: * How a card can reference
   address books which are exported as separate files in the overall
   export * How a card can reference other cards using relatedTo * A
   card can contain arbitrary notes - those are not necessarily exported
   as separate files even though notes are also an object that can be
   included as individual files in a PDPArchive export.

   TODO: figure out if these can have RFC9610 "id" field

   Because a ContactCard item can reference an AddressBook item, if a
   system exports contacts belonging to address books it SHOULD also
   export the referenced AddressBook objects.  Likewise, it SHOULD
   export the other ContactCard objects that are referenced in the
   'relatedTo' field.  A permission or scope inconsistency would be one
   reason why the exporting system would not do so.  For example, if the
   user chose to export only a public address book containing the "John
   Doe" contact, and not the private "Wedding guests" address book that
   John Doe also belonged to, then the private address book would either
   appear as an unresolvable ID or be cleaned up so that it didn't
   appear (implementor's choice).  Likewise, when "John Doe" is exported
   as part of a single address book export, but the friend relation in
   relatedTo is not exported because they're not in the same address
   book, the relatedTo value may be included in the export even if not
   resolvable by some users of the export file.

6.3.2.2.  Group Contact Items

   Group contact items also refer to other contact items.  A file with
   an arbitrary name like "contact2.json" could include:

   {
      "@type": "ContactCard",
      "kind": "group",
      "name": {
        "full": "The Doe family"
      },
      "uid": "urn:uuid:ab4310aa-fa43-11e9-8f0b-362b9e155667",
      "updated": "2021-10-31T22:27:10Z",
      "members": {
        "urn:uuid:03a0e51f-d1aa-4385-8a53-e29025acd8af": true,
        "urn:uuid:b8767877-b4a1-4c70-9acc-505d3819e519": true
      }
   }

   As with individual ContactCard items referencing objects that are not
   exported at the same time, a group contact can contain references
   that are not resolvable within the export.  If the user chooses to
   export all address books then presumably the "The Doe family" group
   members can all be found somewhere in the export, but if they export
   only the address book containing "The Doe family" group and not the
   address books containing individual members, those IDs would not be
   found in the export.

6.3.3.  Using RFC9610 address book objects

   The VCard [RFC6350] specifications never defined a representation for
   address books.  Nor did JSContact [RFC9553].  JMAP for Contacts
   [RFC9610] does.  Its model is clearly that of non-exclusive
   collection membership: a Contact item may appear with the same UID in
   multiple Address Books, and if the Contact item with that UID is
   updated in one it is updated in the other also.

   Individual address book objects are returned in JMAP protocol
   messages with protocol wrappers.  It is the items inside the "list"
   element inside "AddressBook/get" that are nearly ready to be
   represented as individual files in a PDPArchive.  However, some
   things are missing: * uid is called 'id' in JMAP for Contacts but
   this specification REQUIRES uid. * updated is required * The @type of
   AddressBook should be included within the data

   This example copies the examples in RFC9610 so that interoperability
   between this spec and that one is clear.

   A file with an arbitrary name like address-book1.json would contain:

   {
      "@type": "AddressBook",
      "uid": "062adcfa-105d-455c-bc60-6db68b69c3f3",
      "updated": "2020-01-09T14:32:01Z",
      "name": "Personal",
      "description": null,
      "sortOrder": 0,
      "isDefault": true,
      "isSubscribed": true,
      "shareWith": {
        "3f1502e0-63fe-4335-9ff3-e739c188f5dd": {
          "mayRead": true,
          "mayWrite": false,
          "mayShare": false,
          "mayDelete": false
        }
      },
      "myRights": {
        "mayRead": true,
        "mayWrite": true,
        "mayShare": true,
        "mayDelete": false
      }
   }

   address-book2.json would contain:

   {
      "@type": "AddressBook",
      "uid": "cd40089d-35f9-4fd7-980b-ba3a9f1d74fe",
      "updated": "2020-01-09T14:32:01Z",
      "name": "Autosaved",
      "description": null,
      "sortOrder": 1,
      "isDefault": false,
      "isSubscribed": true,
      "shareWith": null,
      "myRights": {
        "mayRead": true,
        "mayWrite": true,
        "mayShare": true,
        "mayDelete": false
      }
   }

   Note that the first example includes a shareWith value, showing that
   the user's AddressBook has been shared with in this case one other
   principal with the id "3f1502e0-63fe-4335-9ff3-e739c188f5dd".  This
   information can be exported and may be quite useful in case of
   backup/restore use cases.  However, it may not be useful in other
   administrative domains where the same concept of principals does not
   allow the Principal ID to be resolved against the correct account.
   In any case, the object referred to by this Principal ID is not
   itself given representation in the PDP Archive export.

6.3.4.  Calendar events, tasks and groups

   JSCalendar [RFC8984] is the basis for representing events, tasks and
   groups in JSON.  This section explains how to export individual
   events and tasks within an archive.  JMAP for Calendars
   (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jmap-calendars/) does
   provide some additional considerations when producing calendar data
   from a JMAP system or to be consumed by a JMAP system, so it is also
   a normative reference.

   Note on CalDAV [RFC4791] compatibility: Although CalDAV servers are
   fairly common, they support the older VEVENT and VTODO syntax.  This
   specification requires the JSCalendar syntax instead.  Either way, a
   server building a personal data archive is likely transforming an
   internal implementation-specific relational data format to an export
   format.

   Note on ETag: CalDAV servers use the event's UID to identify the same
   object, and use ETags to identify changed events, so that a CalDAV
   client may make sure it has the version a server has before it
   updates an item, solving the lost-update problem.  Since this
   specification doesn't attempt to solve the lost-update problem as
   well as client-server protocols can, and since JSCalendar does not
   include the ETag of a calendar event in any way, this specification
   does not include any requirements for ETags.

   Notes on specific fields:

   *  The globally unique uid property is mandatory in JSCalendar and
      MUST be included.  See JMAP Calendars [ref todo] section 1.4.1 for
      when the uid property can appear the same for multiple recurrences
      of the same underlying event.

   *  The updated property is mandatory in JSCalendar and MUST be
      included.

   *  The sequence value is optional in JSCalendar but SHOULD be
      included if available.

   *  The @type property for one of these items MUST be "Event", "Task"
      or "Group".

   *  Recurrence rules SHOULD be fully exported, unless it's clear from
      the use case or user request that the destination for the data
      wants expanded recurrences within a specific time period.

   *  The calendarIds field defined in JMAP Calendars is REQUIRED in
      order to match up events to the calendar they are supposed to
      appear in.

   For example, a file called event1.json could contain:

   {
     "@type": "Event",
     "uid": "2a358cee-6489-4f14-a57f-c104db4dc2f2",
     "updated": "2020-01-09T14:32:01Z",
     "title": "Board Meeting",
     "start": "2024-10-25T09:00:00",
     "timeZone": "Europe/London",
     "duration": "PT1H30M",
     "participants": {
       "1": {
         "@type": "Participant",
         "name": "Jane Doe",
         "sendTo": {
           "mailto": "jane@example.com"
         },
         "roles": {
           "attendee": true
         }
       }
     },
     "calendarIds": {
       "062adcfa-105d-455c-bc60-6db68b69c3f3": true
     }
   }

   The event object includes a calendarIds property, which links it to
   the calendar collection it belongs to.

6.3.5.  Calendar Collection Items

   Calendar collection items are built using JMAP for Calendars [REF
   TODO - still I-D].

   If a system exports events belonging to calendars, it SHOULD also
   export the referenced Calendar objects.

   A file with an arbitrary name, such as calendar1.json, in a directory
   (e.g., \calendars\calendar2) would contain the calendar's metadata:

   {
     "@type": "Calendar",
     "uid": "062adcfa-105d-455c-bc60-6db68b69c3f3",
     "updated": "2020-01-09T14:32:01Z",
     "name": "Work Calendar",
     "color": "#123456",
     "sortOrder": 0,
     "isDefault": true,
     "isSubscribed": true,
     "myRights": {
       "mayRead": true,
       "mayWrite": true,
       "mayShare": true,
       "mayDelete": false
     }
   }

   The uid value here corresponds to the ID used in the calendarIds
   property of the individual event item.

6.3.5.1.  Tasks

   Tasks are also defined by the JSCalendar specification [RFC8984]
   using the "Task" object type.  As with events, tasks MUST include the
   uid and updated fields to support synchronization.

   For example, a file called task1.json could contain:

   {
     "@type": "Task",
     "uid": "7b0f69a6-6e3e-4f1b-85d8-c89b43d2f2a1",
     "updated": "2022-11-23T15:01:32Z",
     "title": "Submit Quarterly Report",
     "status": "in-progress",
     "priority": 1,
     "due": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
   }

6.3.6.  Notes

   *  VJournal is first defined in iCalendar (now [RFC5545]).

   *  VJournal also used in CalDAV [RFC4791].

   *  However, they are NOT used in https://jmap.io/spec-calendars.html

   Do we even have a JSON format for notes defined?

6.3.7.  Files

6.3.8.  Other

   (LMD Note: I think this might better fit in an out of scope section -
   I think out of scope sections are useful for statements that explain
   why scope is limited.  that's assuming we all agree that groups,
   freebusy and timezones are left out.)

   Groups as defined in JSCalendar are NOT part of this archive format.
   Groups in JSCalendar can combine events and tasks in a container.
   This specification, for consistency and simplicity, uses folders and
   requires individual objects to be in separate files.

   VFREEBUSY objects are not part of this archive format.  Calendar
   software can calculate freebusy time from event data.  Use cases that
   are not satisfied by this limitation could extend this archive format
   but understanding what it means to backup, restore, export or import
   freebusy data would need to be fleshed out.

   VTIMEZONE objects are not part of this archive format.  Timezones are
   more likely to be system objects referred to by calendar objects in
   modern calendar systems, than objects which are exchanged across
   systems.

6.4.  Synchronization requirements

   This section describes the requirements to achieve repeated one-way
   synchronization via export/import operations between software by
   different vendors.  While limited, this still provides better
   functionality than what many end-users experience with their
   groupware software and services today.

   Supporting _repeated_ synchronization means that the export from
   system A and import to system B can happen over and over again
   without needlessly duplicating items.  Supporting _one-way_
   synchronization means that changes in the system with the exporter
   role propagate reliably to the system with the importer role, but not
   in the reverse direction.  Some of the constraints here arise from
   the fact that the two systems may not directly connect, and the
   import may be time-delayed from the export.

   This limited solution for export/import sync may also be used for
   more direct system-to-system transfers such as service-to-service
   data transfers, repeated data access requests or data migrations,
   although some of those use cases could be solved much better with
   direct negotiation of features.

6.4.1.  Always include 'uid' and 'updated'

   These requirements apply to JSContact [RFC9553], JSTask and
   JSCalendar [RFC8984] objects when exported or imported using the
   formats in this specification, because these all have 'uid' and
   'updated' values.

   Requirements:

   *  exporters MUST include the UID and updated fields.

   *  The 'updated' field MUST be exported in UTC and interpreted in
      UTC.  Accurate system time is important.

   *  importers MUST use the UID in an imported object, if the importer
      is creating a new object, rather than invent a new UID.

   *  importers MUST search for existing objects with the same UID, and
      if the object in storage is _similar enough_ (see Note below) to
      the import data, the importer SHOULD NOT change the object and
      MUST NOT update its 'updated' timestamp.

   Recommendations:

   *  Importers SHOULD use caution with fields that are system-updated,
      especially frequently updated.  Such fields SHOULD NOT change the
      value of 'updated' that is exported or used to decide whether to
      update an object during an import operation.  See note below on
      'updated'.

   *  Importers SHOULD apply common sense in updating internal or
      implementation-specific fields.  This specification does not
      require the importer to include, omit, handle or disregard values
      for fields that it believes are internally-generated or
      implementation-specific.  For example, a system in the role of
      exporter might export an event object with a video-conference room
      ID in a custom field.  It can decide that it is sensible to export
      that value as a URL for external use.  Later, the same system or
      one with code written for compatibility could import that event
      with the video-conference URL, and it would be sensible to avoid
      overwriting its own knowledge of the room ID with the URL.

   *  When importing a _changed_ or _new_ object with a UID and
      'updated' value, the importer SHOULD set the 'updated' value to
      the one imported.  Thus, if a Contact is updated on Jan 1,
      exported on Jan 2 and imported on Jan 3, the new or updated
      imported contact would show an 'updated' value of Jan 1.

   Note on _similar enough_: This specification requires nuance in order
   to allow both reasonably consistent synchronization and reasonable
   behavior in a wide variety of use cases and implementations.  The
   language above is intended to give implementors both guidance and
   wiggle room.  For example, the importer could convert a DTSTART time
   from UTC to the user's local time and save it as the displayed start
   time.  Later, re-importing the same object with the same UID, the
   importing code could be smart enough to realize that the time hasn't
   _actually_ changed, and avoid changing the 'updated' timestamp or
   creating a conflicting event.  This logic could be implemented by
   saving separate fields (imported time vs display time), by keeping a
   log of updates (log entry stating that the system auto-converted
   start time from X to Y), or by other clever algorithms.  Thus, the
   clever implementation can avoid the appearance of an object that
   changes every time the calendar is synchronized.

   Note on _updated_: The definition of 'updated' in JSContact [RFC9553]
   is not rigorous or nuanced. "when the data in the Card was last
   modified" could refer to several instances of the card -- its
   internal implementation, its representation in an email share, its
   representation in an HTTP GET response (CardDAV, [RFC6352]).  It's
   not specified whether 'updated' is the same as REV in VCard
   [RFC6350], which is defined differently.  Neither definition
   explicitly covers vendor-specific fields.  Thus, this specification
   makes additional recommendations for handling 'updated':

   *  The value of 'updated' SHOULD only change when two conditions
      hold: the end-user makes a decision to change a value of a user-
      visible field, AND the export of the JSContact shows a different
      value.

   *  Thus, non-user-visible fields like 'version' could be changed
      without causing the 'updated' value to change.  A value such as
      'language' could be set without changing 'updated' (if an
      implementation infers the language tag and begins to include 'fr-
      CA' as the language value in exports instead of no language,
      nevertheless this doesn't change the user-visible content).

   *  If implementations need to manage the synchronization of vendor-
      specific fields, a vendor-specific field like
      'example.com:updated' can be used rather than affect the user-
      visible synchronization made possible by 'updated'.
      Implementations could possibly also handle 'updated' differently
      when used for export/import using the formats in this
      specification, than when the same field is handled in other code
      paths.

   We recognize that this understanding of 'updated' is highly
   judgement-dependent.  The same field can change in one way and cause
   a change to 'updated' and in another way may not (the example of
   server inferring the language is 'fr-CA' vs the user explicitly
   setting it).  It is likely to be frustrating to protocol designers
   and implementors (as it is to the authors of this specification) that
   the definition is so wobbly.  We'd love to know of better solutions
   that work with the status quo.

6.4.1.1.  Synchronizing from and to CalDAV servers

   CalDAV [RFC4791] uses URLs, ETags and UIDs for synchronizing changes
   between two systems reliably, but it relies upon client-server
   architecture, where the server is the "source of truth" and the
   client must manage its local history and decide which things to
   update from the server and which things to tell the server to update.
   If a user is setting up synchronization or an implementor is building
   a system that involves synchronization, it may be best to use CalDAV
   if that is a feasible solution.

   Nevertheless, we believe some of the use cases in our use case
   section (use_cases) motivate not only including calendar data in
   these archives for backup purposes, but also for partial updates.
   This works the same way it does for JSContact and JSCard objects.

6.4.2.  Synchronizing address books

   Build on [RFC9610]

6.4.3.  Synchronizing mailbox folders

   Because servers may differ in which characters they support in folder
   names, how many levels deep folders may be created, and even in what
   separator character is used to indicate folder hierarchy,
   difficulties in synchronizing folder names will definitely arise.
   Folder names that are not likely to be widely supported in other
   systems should be translated for export, because if the exporting
   system has a consistent translation algorithm, then even if the
   mailbox name looks different in the importing system it will still be
   imported consistently.

   Systems that support mailbox IDs MUST include them in exports.
   Systems that do not (though it's strongly encouraged) SHOULD use the
   full mailbox name as the unique identifier value.

      TODO: Also it would be good to include a "display name" in case
      the server has had to translate the mailbox name for
      compatibility.  E.g. a server that has a mailbox named "%L33T%",
      but knows the "%" should not be exported because many servers
      forbid the "%", would translate the name consistently to
      _pc_L33T_pc_ or another set of safe characters and include a
      display name of "%L33T%" for reference and debugging.

7.1.  Container format

   This document leverages existing data formats and adds certain files
   for representing metadata.  While one may work with this raw data,
   most import/export scenarios will rather require the bundling of
   individual data items into one or few container files.

   This document does not strive to invent its own container format, but
   may refer to existing ones.

   High level options would be:

   *  Recommend using a container format without preferring a particular
      one

   *  Mandating a specific format

   *  ...?

   Actual container formats likely differ in various dimensions:

   *  Ease of adding incremental data

   *  Ease of updating existing data

   *  Ease of accessing files

   *  Support for compression

   *  Support for data streaming

   *  Availability of library/tool support across platforms

   *  Internal file references

   *  Open standard

   *  ...?

   Candidates

   *  tar/gz

   *  zip

   *  7z

   *  zpaq

7.2.  Encryption

   Support for encryption of any kind is so far no requirement in the
   draft.  However, an increasing number of services offers forms of
   data encryption.  Implications for this draft may be considered.

   "Encryption" might refer to various aspects:

   *  Existing encryption of individual files in the export

   *  Encrypting the complete export (incl. metadata?)

   *  ...?

8.  Implementation status

   < RFC Editor: before publication please remove this section and the
   reference to [RFC7942] >

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
